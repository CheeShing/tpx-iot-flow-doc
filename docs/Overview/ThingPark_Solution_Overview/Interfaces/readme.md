# Interfaces

2 interfaces are available to interact with ThingPark X IoT Flow: a graphical user interface and an API.

## Graphical User Interface - GUI

The GUI is useful to manage the objects interactively and to monitor events in case of problem.
It’s designed to give a meaningful overview of the user’s objects.
You can use the GUI when the number of objects you need to evaluate are under 10, for example when a particular connection must be fixed.
It’s not designed to perform analytics nor bulk operations.

## Application Programmable Interface - API

The IoT Flow REST API is a set of webservices allowing to create and configure the IoT Flows.
The API is useful to allow machines to communicate in order to automate repetitive tasks or integrate with an existing system.
When you need to perform bulk operations, or analytics, the API allows the manipulation of hundreds of objects.
